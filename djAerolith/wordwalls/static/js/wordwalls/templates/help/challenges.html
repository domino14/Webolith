<P>The "Week's Bingo Toughies" list gets updated every Tuesday at midnight PST (i.e. Tuesday 3AM EST). It will have the 50 toughest bingo alphagrams (7 and 8 letter words) of all of the previous week's challenges. The toughest bingos are the ones most commonly missed that week.</P>
<P>If you want to view results of previous challenges you can select a date in the past. You can also play these challenges. Any new records set for older challenges won't count for your medal total, though.
<em>Note: All dates are in Pacific Standard Time (PST).</em>
