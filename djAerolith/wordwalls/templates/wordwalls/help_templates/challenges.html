        <P>The "Week's Bingo Toughies" list gets updated every Tuesday at midnight PST (i.e. Tuesday 3AM EST). It will
            have the 50 toughest bingo alphagrams (7 and 8 letter words) of all of the previous week's challenges. The
            toughest bingos are the ones most commonly missed that week.</P>
        <P>If you want to view results of previous challenges select the date below. You can also play these challenges.
            Any new records set for older challenges won't count for your medal total, though. <em>Note: All dates are in
