<P>These are named lists for each lexicon, which can be used as shortcuts instead of searching by probability. There are also JQXZ lists and CSW-only lists available. There may be more lists in the future. Simply find a list and click Play!</P>
        <P>If you wish to save your progress on a list here, you can enter a list name once you're playing, just like the other lists. The saved list will show up in your saved lists.</P>
