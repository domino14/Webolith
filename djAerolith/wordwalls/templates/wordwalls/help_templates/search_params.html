<P>Here, you can search word lists by probability (and possibly other parameters in the future). Simply select a lexicon and a word length. The minimum probability must always be greater than or equal 1; the maximum probability must be less than or equal to the number of words with that word length -- this number will show up in the "Max probability" label below. In the future, you'll also be able to select multiplayer modes.</P>
        <P>The probabilities are alphagram probabilities, and not word probabilities.</P>
